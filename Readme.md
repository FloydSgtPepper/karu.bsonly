This is a toy project of mine. I wanted to learn how to write a C# source generator. To test and use the
source generator I created a serialization library which encodes / decodes (simplified / similar to) bson documents.

While writing the serialization library I decided to additionally learn about C# API design, especially using C# generics and what the limitations compared to C++ templates are.

While I intend to maintain the project this is just a toy project for me. I have a full time job and family. So do not expect bugs to be fixed or outstanding features to be implemented timely

When learning about C# source generators I looked at a couple of websites and blogs. Therefor I wanted to put the code I wrote in a public repository for others to get some help or inspiration for writing their own source generator.
